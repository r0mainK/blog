Hey there !

My name is Romain Keramitas, I’m a Data Scientist by trade (whatever that means) and an Applied Mathematics Engineer by education, living in Paris. 

I’m passionate about AI as a whole, but have been focusing mainly on NLP due to my work - although I'm quite interested in the less sexy aspects of ML, e.g. data scraping, data consolidation, or model serving.

I work at ~~[PriceHubble](https://pricehubble.com/fr/)~~ ~~[source{d}](/rip)~~ [Artur'In](https://www.arturin.com/) and mainly code in Python.

If you're wondering how I built this site, I used the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (the unreleased version 3 on the master branch). I deploy it automatically on [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/fr), using CircleCI. You can go checkout the [source code](https://github.com/r0mainK/blog) if you're curious how it all comes together.

You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) if you want.
