Hey there !

My name is Romain Keramitas, Iâ€™m a Data Scientist by trade (whatever that means) and an Applied Mathematics Engineer by education, living in Paris. 

Iâ€™m passionate about AI as a whole, but have been focusing mainly on NLP due to my work - although I'm quite interested in the less sexy aspects of ML, e.g. data scraping, data consolidation, or model serving.

I work at ~~[PriceHubble](https://pricehubble.com/fr/)~~ ~~[source{d}](/rip)~~ [Artur'In](https://www.arturin.com/) and mainly code in Python.

If you're wondering how I built this site, I used the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (the unreleased version 3 on the master branch). You can go checkout the [source code](https://github.com/r0mainK/blog) of the website if you're curious ðŸ¤— The website itself is hosted on a [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) instance, deployed using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and served using [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). Additionally, I used [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/fr) to register my domain name and configure DNS, [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to get HTTPS certificates, and I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) to gather analytics.
